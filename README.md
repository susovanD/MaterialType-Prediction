# Predicting material type used for publishing

To predict the material type of the to-be published research based on the document. Below are the different material types where the data should be published:
- Book
- Sound disk
- Video Cassette
- Sound Cassette
- Music
- Mixed
- CR

The dataset has been divided into train and test already.
- Train Data has 31,653 rows and 12 columns.
- Test Data has XXX rows and XXX columns. 

Below given are the details about the different columns of dataset.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/susovanD/MaterialType-Prediction/blob/main/eda.py.ipynb)
Below are some of the points that we found from the data : 
- The full data is from UsageClass=physical, checkouttype=Horizon, and checkoutyear=2005, checkoutmonth=4
- No duplicate data is present in the data.
- Combination of Subject and title should be used to identify the materialtype.
- ~ 69% of the total data are having materialtype as BOOK, followed by SOUNDDISC(~ 13%) and VIDEOCASS(~ 9%).
- Since majority of the data has materialtype as BOOK, if we use this data as it is for model building, it will become imbalanced.

## [ML Model Creation](https://github.com/susovanD/MaterialType-Prediction/blob/main/eda.py.ipynb)
First the data has been splitted into training and testing set and the preprocessed/cleaned. Then the data has been converted to TF-IDF matrix post which it has been fed into different machine learning algorithms. **SVM** and **Random forest Classifier** seemed to have the best accuracy, recall and precission score.
Overall accuracy acheived is ~88%. For more details click on [Model Creation](https://github.com/susovanD/MaterialType-Prediction/blob/main/eda.py.ipynb)
